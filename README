Coffee Vending Machine

What is it?
-------------

This is a project I made for the Computer Architectures class.
It is coded in Assembly for MIPS machines, I hope you'll enjoy it.
It is intended to be only for educational purpose.
You can do whatever you want with this code.

How do I use it?
-------------

There are two beverages in the system, 301 will get you a coffee,
302 will get you a tea. Be aware though, you'll need to put Euro coins
in the machine in order to make it work!
